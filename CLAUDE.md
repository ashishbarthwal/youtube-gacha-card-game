# YouTube Gacha

Browser-based gacha game where YouTube channels become collectible trading cards.
Card stats are derived from real channel data, the same trick Wikigacha (Harusugi, Feb 2026)
plays with Wikipedia article metrics.

This is a portfolio piece and fan tribute. Not a business.

## Owner context

Ash — SDET moving into AI engineering. This repo is a portfolio artifact with two goals,
in order: **real users actually playing it**, and a **directed-AI-engineering showcase** —
the visible process (this file, PLAN.md, DECISIONS.md, `wpN` tags + Releases, commit
messages shaped `WPn: <what and why>`) is itself the exhibit. Keep the receipts honest:
docs must reflect reality, tags/badges only for what exists.

Tests are the safety net, not the centerpiece (reframed 2026-07-18; WP1 delivered them —
56 tests, CI on every push, self-contained HTML reports). Ash is learning GitHub Actions
through this repo: for CI/workflow work, default to guide-and-explain so they type it,
unless they say otherwise.

## The core mapping

| Wikigacha | YouTube Gacha |
|---|---|
| Article quality rank -> rarity | Subscriber count -> rarity |
| Pageviews -> ATK | View count -> ATK |
| Article length -> DEF | Video count -> DEF |

Rarity bands: N (<100K) -> R (<1M) -> SR (<10M) -> SSR (<50M) -> UR (50M+)

## Locked decisions — do not reopen

1. **No monetization inside the game.** No paid pulls, no currency, no perks, no ads.
   Reasons: YouTube API ToS restricts commercial use, cards use creators' names and
   likenesses, and paid gacha invites gambling and minor-protection regulation.
2. **One exception:** a single Buy Me a Coffee link in the footer. Passive, understated,
   no popups, no nags. **Hard rule: the coffee buys Ash a coffee. It never unlocks
   anything in the game.** The moment a donation grants in-game value, every IP and legal
   problem comes back.
3. **Client-side only.** Static host (GitHub Pages / Netlify). Users bring their own
   YouTube Data API key. No backend, no server, near-zero hosting cost.
4. **No build step.** Plain ES modules, served as-is. Vitest runs in dev only.
5. **Unofficial.** Footer must carry a disclaimer: not affiliated with or endorsed by
   YouTube or Google. (Wikigacha does the same for Wikipedia.)

## Scope boundaries

Currently out of scope: battles, decks, pity system, `/c/` vanity URL resolution
(handles and UC ids only), server-side persistence, accounts.

Card look (revised WP3): the metal-bevel **tier frame and the holo/tilt finish carry the
card** — that principle is unchanged. What changed is the avatar's role. It is no longer a
small inset; it sits as the centrepiece inside a metal ring. Because a real creator's face is
now prominent, two rules follow: the live adapter fetches the **highest-res thumbnail
available (up to 800px)** so it is not soft, and the finish layers are painted **below** the
avatar so the holo/glare never tint it. Still pull an accent color from the avatar, and keep
the channel initial as a **faint monogram** behind it.

## Architecture

Two things matter structurally:

**The data seam.** The bundled **starter set**, fetched **sets** (curated snapshot JSON),
and **live** sources produce an identical channel object shape, so nothing downstream can
tell them apart. This is why the app works offline (the starter set is bundled, not
fetched), why the tests never need an API key, why the starter set is a real set behind the
seam rather than a hack, and why versioned card sets ship as plain static files. There are
two user-facing modes — **Sets** (default; starter set + any fetched sets in a picker) and
**Live** (bring-your-own-key). The old standalone "Demo" mode was folded into the starter
set (see DECISIONS.md).

**The pure core.** `rarityFromSubs` and `statsFrom` are pure and deterministic — no I/O,
no randomness, no DOM. They sit between the seam and everything stateful. This is the
test target.

## Conventions

- Vanilla JS, ES modules, no framework, no bundler.
- Pure logic lives in `src/core.js` and imports nothing.
- Anything touching the network lives behind `src/data/`.
- Anything touching the DOM lives in `src/ui/`.
- Fonts: Anton (display), Space Grotesk (body), Space Mono (stats/numbers).
- Palette: dark plum stage, YouTube-red accents.
- Record any new decision that closes off an option in `DECISIONS.md`.
