# Decisions

Append-only. One entry per decision that closes off an option. Newest at the bottom.

**No monetization in the game.** No paid pulls, currency, perks, or ads. YouTube API ToS
restricts commercial use, cards use creators' names and likenesses, and paid gacha invites
gambling and minor-protection regulation. Harusugi ran Wikigacha free at launch with only a
Buy Me a Coffee link. We do the same.

**One Buy Me a Coffee link, no strings.** Passive tip jar in the footer. It buys Ash a
coffee and never unlocks anything in-game. If a donation ever grants in-game value, every
IP and legal problem above comes back.

**Client-side only, user-supplied API key.** Static host, no backend. This is what makes
the cost question mostly evaporate, which is what makes the monetization question easy.

**No build step.** Plain ES modules. Vitest is a dev dependency and does not touch the
shipped artifact.

**Split the single file into modules (WP0).** Vitest cannot import functions out of a
`<script>` tag inside an HTML file, so the single-file build made the test suite
impossible. The tests are a portfolio goal, so the file structure has to serve them.

**Handles and UC ids only.** `/c/` vanity URLs are not resolved. They require an extra
search API call and a heuristic match, and the cost is not worth it.

**No persistence yet.** In-memory state only, to stay safe in sandboxed previews.
Revisit once the app is being served from a real static host.

**Hidden subscriber counts read as N.** The API omits `subscriberCount` and sets
`hiddenSubscriberCount: true` for channels that hide it. The core treats that — and any
malformed count — as the lowest band rather than throwing, so a card always renders.
To be pinned by tests in WP1.

**Accent color: sample the avatar, fall back to a hash.** Live avatars are cross-origin;
when canvas sampling is blocked (CORS taint) or the avatar is near-grey, the accent is
derived from a hash of the channel id instead. Deterministic either way, never blocks
rendering.

**Card sets are the primary pull source.** Curated, versioned channel snapshots ("Series")
ship as static JSON — players never need an API key. Demo mode becomes the built-in starter
set; live BYO-key mode stays as a power feature. Chosen over shipping a shared
referrer-restricted key as the default (that stays open as a fallback idea).

**Series are monthly printings of ~300–500 cards.** YouTube's Developer Policies cap stored
statistics at 30 days, so a scheduled snapshot refresh re-cuts each set monthly and cards
carry a "stats as of <month>" label. Compliance and TCG set-symbol flavor from one mechanism.
Curation flow: candidate lists are drafted with a target rarity mix (~N 40 / R 30 / SR 18 /
SSR 9 / UR 3 %), then human-approved before snapshotting.

**One app, many banners — the codebase never forks.** Genre sets (gaming, commentary, …) are
banners inside a single deployment. Themed sister deployments stay possible later from the
same code with different default set + palette, but they are a deploy config, not a fork.

**Opt-out for channel owners.** Real people become cards, so the footer gains a contact
line and removal requests are honored promptly (policy requires deletion within 7 days for
user-data requests; we extend the courtesy to set membership).

**WP0 done: monolith split, entry is `index.html`.** `youtube-gacha.html` is deleted; the
app is ES modules under `src/`, loaded via `<script type="module" src="src/main.js">`.
Behavior is unchanged (verified: pure-core values match, and demo mode boots to the
identical 8-chip banner). `toCard` moved into `core.js` (it is pure — the model bridge,
not a renderer) so `state.js` depends on `core`, never the reverse.

**Two files beyond the planned tree: `src/state.js` and `src/ui/util.js`.** `state.js`
holds the shared in-memory `state` + `currentPool`/`addToCollection` so `banner`,
`collection`, and `main` import one owner instead of threading it through every call.
`ui/util.js` holds `escapeHtml` (used by both `card` and `banner`) rather than coupling
`banner → card` for a generic helper. `main.js` stays wiring-only; `banner` takes an
`onPull` callback so it never imports the pull glue.

**Live adapter normalizes `customUrl` to the `@handle` shape.** The API's
`customUrl` is not guaranteed handle-shaped — older channels return a bare,
lowercased vanity string ("mkbhd") where the modern format is "@mkbhd". The
live adapter prepends `@` when missing so the `handle` field always matches the
Channel typedef and the demo/sets adapters. Empty stays empty.

**WP1 done: 56 tests pin the pure core and the pull engine.** Vitest is the repo's first
and only dependency, dev-only — the shipped app still has zero. `test/core.test.js` pins
every rarity boundary from both sides (string and number inputs), the hidden-subs-read-as-N
rule, junk-input safety, and monotonic/multiplier stat scaling. `test/gacha.test.js` injects
mulberry32 (a tiny seeded PRNG) so x10 size, dupe stacking, and the N>R>SR>SSR>UR frequency
order are exact, reproducible assertions rather than flaky statistics.

**Local dev needs a JS-MIME static server, not `file://`.** ES modules are blocked over
`file://`, and browsers reject module scripts served as `text/plain` (Python's
`http.server` does this on Windows). `npx serve` is the recommended local server;
GitHub Pages / Netlify serve correct types, so hosting is unaffected. README updated.

**WP2 done: coffee link published under `ChunChunMaru`, disclaimer already present.**
The footer's "not affiliated with YouTube/Google" line predated WP2, so WP2 added only the
tip jar: a single passive text link to `buymeacoffee.com/chunchunmaru`, coffee-accent
(SSR gold) on hover, opens in a new tab, wired to nothing in the game. Published under the
social handle ChunChunMaru rather than the real name, by choice. The hard rule holds — the
coffee buys Ash a coffee and never unlocks anything in-game. Unlike Wikigacha's CC BY-SA
line (which grants reuse rights downstream), our footer disclaims a relationship; we have no
license to grant, so the notice can only ever be a disclaimer, never an attribution.

**Card face stays clean; the export carries the disclaimer (WP5).** Studying Wikigacha's
card up close: its CC BY-SA line lives on the pack art and page footer, not on the card face.
We follow the same split but for a different reason — our disclaimer is risk management, not
an attribution debt, and the risk peaks when a card leaves our page. So the in-app card face
stays uncluttered (WP3's frame/finish do the work), and the WP5 PNG export stamps a small
"unofficial fan card · stats as of <month> · not affiliated with YouTube" line into the image
itself, because the export is the version that travels without page context.

**Test report is a self-contained monolith HTML, rendered from the JUnit XML.**
`@vitest/ui`'s HTML report was tried and dropped: it is an app (assets folder, gzipped
metadata, needs a server), and a report should be a document — double-clickable,
mailable, archivable. `tools/test-report.js` renders the JUnit XML we already emit into
one dependency-free HTML file per run, timestamped, failure traces inline. Dev
dependencies are back down to Vitest alone. The failure path is verified, not assumed:
a deliberately failing test must render a FAIL report and exit non-zero for CI.

**Consume the API's integer fields; never parse a localized subscriber display.** The Data
API returns counts as locale-free decimal strings (`"21083412"`). The app parses those
(`core.toCount`) and formats them itself (`ui/util.formatCount` → "21.1M"), so we own the
presentation instead of inheriting YouTube's. Scraping a channel page would instead force us
to read *localized display text* — "1.24M subscribers" / "登録者数123万人" / "1,24 Mio.
Abonnenten" — where the number, the suffix, the separators, and the unit (Japanese 万 = tens
of thousands) all change by region. That is brittle and locale-dependent to parse, on top of
the usual scrape fragility (undocumented JSON fields, ambiguous matches — a live scrape of one
small channel already returned a `… views` number we couldn't confirm was the channel total).
So `build-set.js` (WP4) fetches creator data via `channels.list`, never by page scraping. The
HTML scrape used to hand-prototype single cards under `card-prototype/` was a throwaway
sandbox shortcut, never the pipeline and never the app — the live adapter has always used the
API. (Localization angle surfaced in a 2026-07 external design review; recorded here so the
reasoning outlives that conversation.)

**WP3 done: holographic finish gated by rarity, and the CSS is now its own file.**
`index.html`'s inline `<style>` moved wholesale into `styles.css` (planned split, taken at
WP3 as the note said, not before). The finish is a pointer-tracked white glare, a masked
rainbow holo sweep, and a 3D tilt — kept separate from the per-rarity *frame*, which already
lived in the card rules. Intensity is three custom properties (`--tilt-max`,
`--glare-strength`, `--holo-strength`) set once per rarity band and read by shared rules, so
the gating lives in exactly one place: N stays flat/matte (all three zero), R gets a plain
sheen (glare, no holo), SR/SSR add the holo, UR adds a slow shimmer. Interactive tilt lives
in `ui/holo.js`, delegated on the persistent Collection grid so it survives the grid's
innerHTML re-render, and is **scoped to the collection, not the reveal overlay** — a tilt on
the reveal cards would fight the flip transform. It binds only for a fine pointer with motion
allowed; touch/coarse and `prefers-reduced-motion` fall back to a faint static finish (or
nothing for N) in CSS, so a card is never left broken. Still zero app dependencies, still no
build step. The `card-prototype/` SSR sandbox proved the effect first; the shipped version
generalizes it across all five bands.

**Rarity tiers ARE the YouTube Creator Awards.** The rarity thresholds (100K / 1M / 10M /
50M) are exactly the Silver / Gold / Diamond / Custom-("Red Diamond") play-button thresholds,
so the tiers name themselves: N=Graphite, R=Silver, SR=Gold, SSR=Diamond, UR=Red Diamond.
This replaced the earlier arbitrary N-grey/R-blue/SR-purple/SSR-gold/UR-red hues with a
palette that ties the whole look back to YouTube. Each tier is one `--t-*` custom-property set
(bevel stops, glow, badge ink) so a card recolours by rarity from a single source, and the
chip dots read the same `--rc`, so chips and cards can never disagree.

**Card redesigned to a bevel-frame hero card (from the `card-prototype/` look).** A conic
metal-bevel "seam" wraps a dark inner face: rarity badge + tier label top-left, name + handle
top-right, the avatar as a ringed centrepiece, subs line + ATK/DEF boxes at the bottom, faint
monogram behind. All internal sizes are **container-query units (`cqw` + `clamp`)**, so one
markup scales cleanly from the collection grid to the inspector with no per-size overrides.

**Avatar promoted from inset to centrepiece — reverses the old "small inset" guardrail.**
Recorded in CLAUDE.md. Two consequences: the live adapter now fetches the largest thumbnail
(high 800px → medium → default) instead of the 88px default, and **the holo/glare finish is
layered below the avatar** (`.avatar-stage` sits above the finish) so a real creator's face is
never colour-shifted by the effect. The frame and finish still do the heavy lifting; the
avatar is protected art, like the clear window on a physical trading card.

**UR's finish is a molten sheen + a smouldering ember, not a flowing colour sweep.** The
first WP3 pass gave UR a constantly-scrolling rainbow background; it read as distracting and
made the SSR diamond's rainbow out-shine the top tier. Replaced with: a warm gold→crimson
holo (distinct from SSR's cool rainbow, so UR doesn't compete on the same axis), a bi-metal
red+gold bevel, a warm glare, and a slow irregular **ember flicker on the frame glow only**.
Motion is gated to `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`; reduced-motion gets the static
frame. Interior intensity is deliberately lower than the edge so the centre never overwhelms.

**Card inspector: click a collection card to admire it large.** A centred overlay over a
blurred backdrop shows one enlarged card with the same tilt/holo enabled (so it can be turned
in the light). It reuses `renderCard` — the container-query sizing means the big card needs no
special styling. Closes on button / backdrop / Escape and restores focus. Kept out of the
reveal overlay, which has its own flip.

**Reveal column count is pinned in JS, not left to `auto-fit`.** A x10 reveal alternated
between 5-wide and 4-wide because a vertical scrollbar stealing ~17px could reflow the grid,
and each layout was self-stable. `reveal.js` now sets `--reveal-cols = min(cards, 5)` and the
grid uses `minmax(0, 148px)` columns, so cards shrink a hair rather than dropping a column —
the scrollbar can no longer change the count. A x1 is a single centred card.

**Dev Pull is a testing affordance, explicitly not a game mechanic.** A green "Dev Pull"
button fires a 10-pull seeded with one card of every rarity present in the pool, then filled
with normal weighted pulls, so every tier's treatment shows in one reveal while tuning
visuals. It must be gated (`?dev`) or stripped before the real-users build; it never changes
the published drop rates.

**Throwaway HTML sandboxes removed.** The scraped YouTube page dumps (`mkbhd.html`,
`yuntaku.html`, `yuntaku-about.html` — ~5 MB of third-party page source at the repo root) and
the hand-built `card-prototype/` mock-ups are deleted now that the real cards render in the
app. Each was single-use: the scrapes gave stat numbers for hand-prototyping (never the
pipeline — the live adapter always used the API), the prototypes proved the frame/finish look
(now generalized across all five bands in WP3). References to them in the entries above are
historical. Removing them shrinks the repo and drops the committed third-party HTML.

**WP4 app-side: card sets are a third adapter behind the seam, surfaced as a "Sets" banner
mode.** `data/sets.js` splits like the rest of the codebase — `parseSet` is pure and validated
(8 new tests), `loadSet` is the thin fetch wrapper. A set is the envelope
`{ slug, title, series, snapshotDate, channels[] }`; every channel is the exact Channel shape
demo/live emit, so the gacha, reveal, render and collection code took **zero** changes to
consume a set — the seam's whole point, demonstrated. Sets appear as a **third mode
(Demo | Sets | Live)** rather than folding demo into a set-picker: the smaller, incremental
change, chosen over the earlier "demo becomes the starter set" reframing (which stays open for
later). The picker is populated from a `sets/index.json` manifest that `build-set.js` will
maintain.

**The first set ships with fictional channels, not real creators.** `sets/sample-series.json`
("Arcade Legends") is eight invented channels spanning every rarity (N→UR). It proves the
adapter, picker, and rarity spread without committing any real creator metadata while the
YouTube API storage / likeness questions are still being clarified with Google. `build-set.js`
will emit the identical shape from real channels once that clears — no app code changes. Sets
are keyed on the immutable UC id (handle is display-only), so a set is handle-change-proof and
self-heals its display fields on each monthly re-snapshot; a UC id that 404s on refresh
(deleted/terminated channel) must be dropped or flagged, never shipped as a broken card.

**Local-dev API-key convenience: a gitignored `config.local.js`.** So live mode needn't have
the key re-pasted on every reload, `banner.js` dynamically imports `config.local.js` and
pre-fills the field if it exports `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`. The import rejects harmlessly when the
file is absent — which is every deployment, so the shipped app still has no key and no such
file, and the memory-only guarantee to players holds. The file is gitignored via an explicit
`config.local.js` entry (its name doesn't match the pre-existing `*.local` rule). Working and
rationale notes (external LLM dumps, the static-sets-vs-backend case) live in a gitignored
`external-docs/` and are deliberately not part of the repo.
